# 📊 Survey Form Project: clevas_HW9

****

## 🌟 Project Overview

This repository contains the files for **Homework 9: Survey Form**, which was my first dedicated project utilizing HTML form elements to create a functional and engaging user survey.

The primary goal of this assignment was to demonstrate proficiency in implementing a variety of standard form input types, focusing on user experience and data validation.

### Key Skills Demonstrated

* Creating required fields using the `required` attribute.
* Implementing **dropdown select boxes** for pre-defined options.
* Utilizing **radio buttons** and **checkboxes** for single and multiple selections.
* Structuring the form with appropriate `<label>` and `<fieldset>` tags for accessibility.
